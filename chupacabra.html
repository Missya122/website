            <p class="section-info">
                For the non-Puerto Ricans among us, the Chupacabra is a creature that is currently rampaging through the
                island, relieving farm animals of their blood. As of yet, the Chupacabra, which translates into
                "goat-sucker", has not attacked humans, although no one can say for certain that this will not happen in
                the future. The origin of its name comes from its earliest attacks, where goats were found with their
                blood drained and with two peculiar puncture marks on their necks. There have been reports alleging that
                particular organs were missing from some of the victim's bodies, without any visible way for those
                organs to have been removed. Sightings have increased as the months go by, fueling paranoia and fear.

            </p>
            <p class="section-info">Speculation has placed the Chupacabra as a resident of another galaxy (see the truth
                behind the Chupacabra), or a half-man, half-beast vampire who roams the countryside terrorizing farm
                animals. Others say that the Chupacabra hops like a kangaroo and leaves a sulfur-like stench. Still
                others say that the Chupacabra is a panther-like creature with red eyes and a long snake-like tongue. I,
                for one, think that the truth may lie in the UFO area my theory being that the Chupacabra is actually
                the pet panther, which hops like a kangaroo, of some irresponsible aliens who let it wander around. Like
                obnoxious relatives, who let their children rampage through the house, the aliens have overstayed their
                welcome in our island. </p>
